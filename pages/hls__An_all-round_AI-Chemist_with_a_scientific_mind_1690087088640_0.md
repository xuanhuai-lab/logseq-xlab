- As shown in Fig. 2A, based on syntax rules, domain dictionaries and machine learning, we build a scientific text data-mining system with eight natural language processing (NLP) steps. This system can decompose titles, paragraphs and sentences by text classification, locate important regions by word tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, name entity recognition, perform grammatical analysis, extract entity relationships and realize co-reference resolutions and error corrections. The NLP steps convert scientific texts into structured data understandable for AI.

- The above-mentioned two tasks have proven that mobile robot and smart workstations can successfully execute various experimental operations. Next, we integrate them with the service platform and computational brain to act as an AI-Chemist to conduct all-round chemical research. We take the non-noble metal oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst as an example. It has been shown that high-entropy alloy nanoparticles containing more than four different elements have high potential to be the choice for future electrocatalysts due to their structural stability, diversity of adsorption sites and remarkable catalytic activity [23–26].
